A possible small lispy syntax, until we have something UI-able:

(query e
  (must (< e.Pos.y 500))
  (set e.Pos.y (+ e.Pos.y delta))
  (draw! e))

But actually we now take continuations in the AST (instead of having statement lists), so:

(query e
  (must (< e.Pos.y 500)
    (set e.Pos.y (+ e.Pos.y delta)
      (draw! e))))

Though if we could batch effects into a statement list, could help.
Or generally, to have lists.. though that's somewhat syntactic only.
